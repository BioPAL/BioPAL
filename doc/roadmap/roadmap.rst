BioPAL Roadmap
==============

This roadmap outlines tasks and features we will be investing resources
in to reach BioPAL's first releas, v0.1.0, in January 2021. It may be used
to encourage and inspire developers and collaboration.

Discussions about what will be included in the roadmap can be found
* in `meeting_notes`_ 
* in the BioPAL  `roadmap_issue`_


Vision 2021
===========

- BioPAL strives to provide an example of Open Source Project best practices for the BIOMASS community, including governance structures, contributing guidlines, code contribution agreements, continuous integration and testing, and other collaborative infrastructure.
- BioPAL will contain a first open source version (v0.1.0) of the working BioL2 AGB processor, including improved documentation, code formatting and a user friendly Python API.
- The BioPAL community aims to refactor the current API into a higher and lower level user API, leveraging python modules, classes and functions. This API supports scientists to focus and improve on one aspect of the source code, through lower level access while full orchestration capabilities remain in place.
